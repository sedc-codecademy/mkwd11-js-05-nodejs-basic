Exercise #1

- When the default url is hit return HTML content to the user, the content of your choice.
- When the url /student is hit, return HTML with the informations:
  -Student name: "your name";
  -Student lastname: "your lastname";
  -Academy: "the academy you are at";
  -Subject: "the current subject we are learning";

Exercise #2

- Create server using HTTP module;
- When the default url is hit return HTML content to the user, the content of your choice.
- When the url /add_student is hit, return a form with one input and a button.
- When we submit the button we will navigate to a new route /all_students
- In this new url /all_students get the value that is sent from the form =).
- And console.log it human readable format =)

BONUS:

- Instead of console.log the value from the form, use the FS module to write in a file named: students.txt

HINT: Use the code from class as inspiration/guide =)
