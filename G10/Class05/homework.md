# Class 06 Homework - The Trainer Api

## Basic Requirement

As we built a student api on class now it will your homework to build a trainer api.

1. The trainer api needs to work with a list of trainer objects that look like this:
   - `id`: string;
   - `firstName`: string;
   - `lastName`: string;
   - `email`: string;
   - `isCurrentlyTeaching`: boolean;
   - `timeEmployed`: string (ex: 6 months or 1 year 3 months);
   - `coursesFinished`: number;
2. Create your trainers.json file and you can add some starting data here if you want to.
3. Create a `trainers.routes.js` and `trainers.service.js` files that will work the way we implemented it in class.
4. Add CRUD operations for the api:
   1. Get all trainers.
   2. Get trainer by id.
   3. Update Trainer Info.
   4. Add a trainer.
   5. Delete trainer.
   6. Delete all trainers.
5. Add a public folder in the project that will serve an `index.html` statically on route `/home`

## Bonus Requirement

The bonus is to add functionality with query params

1. Return only trainers that are currently teaching `?currentlyActive=true`
2. Sort trainers by the number of courses they have finished `?sortBy=coursesAsc` or `?sortBy=coursesDesc`, you don't have to do both here, one is sufficient.
3. In the public folder add an image of your choice that can be acessed using the route `/home/imageName.jpg` served statically.
