# Blog posts App

- Create a simple blog application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

## Note:

- The blog object should have the following properties:
  - id (string), title (string), body(string), author(string), date(string), tags (array of strings)

## Requirements:

- The user should be able to view a list of all blog posts.
- The user should be able to create a new blog post.
- The user should be able to edit an existing blog post. (only the properties title, body and tags are editable)
- The user should be able to delete a blog post.
- The application should use the MVC pattern.

BONUS:

- Implement a route that will filter out, and return only those blogs which tags property includes the given keywords provided through query params.
